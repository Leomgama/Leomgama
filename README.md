## 👤 About Me

I’m a **Data Analyst** with a **BBA in Business Administration** and a strong foundation in **finance, business analytics, and data visualization**.

I enjoy turning raw data into clear, actionable insights that support smarter business decisions. My background combines **business thinking and technical analytics**, which helps me connect data to real-world performance, trends, and strategy.

I work with **SQL, Power BI (DAX), Excel, R, and Python**, and I use tools like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, and VS Code** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

I’m especially interested in:
